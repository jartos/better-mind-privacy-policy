    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application <strong>Better Mind</strong>
      (“the app”) processes information related to its users. The app is designed
      in line with the principles of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
      (GDPR) and similar data protection laws in other jurisdictions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app is intended for users who are at least 14 years old.
      <strong>The app does not include third‑party ads or ad tracking.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>In this Privacy Policy, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the data controller:</p>
    <p>
      Name: <strong>Jarno Tossavainen</strong><br>
      Business ID: <strong>3567327-2</strong><br>
      Country: <strong>Finland</strong><br>
      Email: <a href="mailto:jarnotossavainenapps@gmail.com">jarnotossavainenapps@gmail.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Subjects</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to users who install and use the Better Mind app.
      The app can be used anonymously without creating an account.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data We Process and Sources of Data</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Personal Data and Other Information</h3>
    <p>
      The Better Mind app <strong>does not collect or store</strong> the following
      information on servers controlled by us:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name, email address or username</li>
      <li>Passwords or other login credentials</li>
      <li>Profile information (such as age group or preferences)</li>
      <li>Location data (precise or approximate)</li>
      <li>Push notification tokens</li>
      <li>Journal entries, notes or similar content in any cloud service</li>
      <li>
        Analytics data about how you use the app (for example, screen views or
        button clicks) tied to your identity
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The app does <strong>not</strong> require you to create a user account and
      does not send personally identifiable information about you to our own backend
      or cloud services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content created within the app (for example, any entries or settings) is
      stored <strong>only on your own device</strong>. This local data is permanently
      deleted when you uninstall the app or clear the app’s data from your device.
      We do not have access to this local data.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Payment-Related Information</h3>
    <p>
      Better Mind offers paid features (for example, subscriptions or one-time purchases).
      Payments and purchase validation are handled by the following third‑party services:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Play Billing (Google LLC)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Apple Pay / App Store (Apple Inc.)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat, Inc.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Actual payment information (such as credit or debit card numbers) is processed
      by Google, Apple and/or RevenueCat in accordance with their own terms and
      privacy policies. We do not store or have access to your full payment card details.
    </p>
    <p>We may receive from these providers certain technical information about your purchases, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Product or subscription type (for example, product ID)</li>
      <li>Subscription status (active / expired)</li>
      <li>
        Technical identifiers that allow us to link purchases to a device or
        anonymous user identifier
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use this information <strong>only</strong> to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>verify that your purchase or subscription is valid; and</li>
      <li>enable the corresponding premium features in the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use this information for direct marketing or profiling.</p>

    <h2>4. Purposes and Legal Bases for Processing</h2>
    <p>
      The processing of personal data in connection with Better Mind is very limited
      and mainly concerns the technical handling of purchases via third‑party providers.
    </p>
    <p>We process data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and operate the Better Mind app</li>
      <li>
        To technically enable and validate in-app purchases and subscriptions
        (via Google Play Billing, Apple Pay / App Store and RevenueCat)
      </li>
      <li>To troubleshoot technical issues and prevent misuse or fraud</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Under GDPR, the main legal bases for processing are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Performance of a contract</strong> (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR): to
        provide access to premium content and functionality that you purchase.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal obligations</strong> (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR): some
        purchase-related data may be retained by third‑party providers (such as
        Google or Apple) to comply with accounting or other statutory requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR): ensuring the
        proper operation of the app, preventing misuse and resolving technical issues.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If your local law provides other or additional legal grounds, we rely on those
      to the extent they apply.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Because we do not store your personal data in our own systems, retention mainly
      concerns:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Local data on your device</strong><br>
        Content and settings within the Better Mind app are stored only on your device.
        This data is deleted when you uninstall the app or clear the app’s data from
        your device. We have no access to this data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Purchase and subscription information at Google, Apple and RevenueCat</strong><br>
        These providers may retain information in accordance with their own terms and
        applicable laws (for example, for accounting or fraud prevention). We only
        access the information necessary to verify your entitlement to use premium
        features (for example, whether your subscription is active).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>6. Sources of Data</h2>
    <p>Data we process is obtained from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your own device (local app data, which we do not see)</li>
      <li>
        Google Play Billing, Apple Pay / App Store and RevenueCat (technical purchase
        and subscription information)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not obtain personal data about you from data brokers or for
      marketing/profiling purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing, “Sale” and Targeted Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information.
      <strong>
        We do not sell your personal information or share it with third parties for
        cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not share your personal information with third parties for their own
      marketing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data may be processed by the following service providers to the extent necessary
      for the operation of Better Mind and for handling purchases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Play (Google LLC)</strong> – app distribution and purchases
        on Android devices
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Apple (Apple Inc.) / Apple Pay / App Store</strong> – purchases on
        Apple devices
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RevenueCat, Inc.</strong> – subscription management and receipt validation
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We may also disclose data if required by law, regulation, or a valid legal
      request from a competent authority.
    </p>

    <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Google, Apple and RevenueCat may process data in countries outside the European
      Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), including the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      When such transfers occur, we and our service providers rely on appropriate
      legal safeguards such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, and/or</li>
      <li>other safeguards required by applicable data protection laws.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more details, please refer to each provider’s own privacy documentation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Play / Google LLC – see Google’s Privacy Policy</li>
      <li>Apple / Apple Pay / App Store – see Apple’s Privacy Policy</li>
      <li>RevenueCat, Inc. – see RevenueCat’s Privacy Policy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on where you live (for example, in the EU, UK, or certain U.S. states),
      you may have some or all of the following rights regarding personal data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to be informed about how your data is processed</li>
      <li>The right to access your personal data</li>
      <li>The right to have inaccurate or incomplete data corrected</li>
      <li>The right to request deletion of your data (“right to be forgotten”)</li>
      <li>The right to restrict processing in certain circumstances</li>
      <li>The right to object to processing based on legitimate interests</li>
      <li>The right to data portability, where applicable</li>
      <li>The right to withdraw consent if processing is based on your consent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>
        If you are a resident of California or another U.S. state with specific privacy
        laws, you may have additional rights regarding your personal information.
        Because Better Mind does not create user accounts or store personal data on
        our own servers, many of these rights are limited in practice, but you can
        still contact us and we will review your request in line with applicable law.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because our direct processing of personal data is very limited and much of the
      relevant data is held by Google, Apple or RevenueCat, we will assess each request
      on a case‑by‑case basis and may direct you to contact the relevant provider
      when appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to exercise your rights or have questions about your privacy,
      please contact us using the details in section 13.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority
      or other supervisory authority in your country or region if you believe that
      your rights have been violated.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      Better Mind does not use browser cookies within the app, but it may rely on
      technical identifiers provided by your device and the app stores (for example,
      identifiers used by Google Play or Apple for purchase validation and technical
      operation).
    </p>
    <p>
      The app does <strong>not</strong> include third‑party ads or third‑party ad tracking.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We and our service providers use appropriate technical and organizational
      measures to protect information in connection with the Better Mind app, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Secure connections (for example, HTTPS)</li>
      <li>Access controls and permissions</li>
      <li>Platform-level and server-level security safeguards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we
      cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time if the Better Mind app
      or applicable laws change. When we make material changes, we will notify you
      in the app or through another appropriate channel where feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “Last updated” date at the top shows when this Privacy Policy was last revised.
    </p>
